# Crud-Simple-App-MEN
This is a simple small app that has different functionalities that can allow use 
to make different actions

I built this app using MongoDB/Express and NodeJs, it's a simple CRUD app with a lot of functionalities

In this app I practiced a lot of things just to refresh my memory as : 

the connection between the front and back end

rendering the data on the browser

fixing bugs and erros

creating many folders and files to scruture and organise my workspace so the code can be readable

Creating Modules and Apis

And creating the methods that will allow the user from UI to :
create a new user
update his information
delete his information


I TRIED To TEST the APIs using post main GET/POST/DELETE/PUT methods

I created my queries due to the mongodb

Using Morgan to help me to log messages everytime when i make a request

And its my first try with the ejs which is the embeded JavaScript template that allowed me to build
a dynamic web app

And Express
